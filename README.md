<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Quick Genre Search makes it easier to find books in niche sub-genres. 

### Why is it difficult to find books in nice genres?
* Libraries and bookstores don't always have sections for niche sub-genres, so it can be hard to find what you're looking for.
* Books are typically shelved by author in alphabetical order, but if you search Google for a genre, the result is an unorganized, overwhelming list of authors.

### How does Quick Book Search solve these problems?
* You can **search for a genre** and get a list of the top 25 authors of that genre in alphabetical order. This makes it easier to search bookshelves in bookstores and libraries.
* You can **search for an author** to find the genres they write. This helps you identify the genres an author writes.
